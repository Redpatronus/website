## Remediation / Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-30284

**Vulnerability Description:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists in Adobe ColdFusion versions 2023.12, 2021.18, 2025.0 and earlier.

**Severity:** 8.0 (High)

**Known Exploit:** Exploitation requires user interaction. A victim must open a malicious file leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

**Remediation:**

*   **Apply Patch:** Immediately upgrade to a patched version of Adobe ColdFusion.  Refer to Adobe's security bulletin for the specific patched version number.
*   **Disable Deserialization (if possible):** Investigate if deserialization functionality can be disabled or restricted within the ColdFusion environment if it's not essential for operations.

**Mitigation:**

*   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening files from untrusted sources.  Emphasize the importance of verifying the sender and file origin before opening any attachments or downloading files.
*   **Email Security:** Implement robust email security measures, including spam filtering and malware detection, to identify and block potentially malicious emails containing weaponized files.
*   **Endpoint Protection:** Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions with behavioral analysis capabilities to detect and prevent suspicious activity resulting from successful exploitation.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to limit the impact of a successful exploit. Restrict access to sensitive systems from compromised hosts.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect suspicious activity, such as unexpected process execution or network connections.  Alerting should be configured for potential indicators of compromise.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure ColdFusion is running with the least privileges necessary to perform its function.  Limit the potential damage from arbitrary code execution.
*   **File Type Restriction:** Limit the types of files that ColdFusion processes or accepts as input.  Restrict to only necessary file types.
