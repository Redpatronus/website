## CVE-2025-27364: Remote Code Execution in MITRE Caldera

This document outlines the vulnerability, its severity, potential exploits, and remediation/mitigation strategies for CVE-2025-27364.

**Description:**

CVE-2025-27364 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability found in the dynamic agent (implant) compilation functionality of MITRE Caldera versions 4.2.0 and 5.0.0 (before commit 35bc06e).  The vulnerability exists within the server component of Caldera.  An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a crafted web request to the Caldera server API used for compiling and downloading Caldera's Sandcat or Manx agent (implants).  Specifically, the `gcc -extldflags` linker flag can be leveraged with sub-commands to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server running Caldera.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  (Network, Low Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Scope Changed, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, High Availability Impact)

The CVSS score indicates a critical severity due to the ability of an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the Caldera server. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, data corruption, and denial of service.

**Known Exploit:**

The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious web request to the Caldera server API responsible for agent compilation and download. The request leverages the `gcc -extldflags` linker flag, which is used to pass options to the linker during the compilation process. By injecting malicious sub-commands within this flag, an attacker can instruct the linker to execute arbitrary code on the server during the agent compilation process. This could involve running shell commands, writing files, or performing other actions with the privileges of the Caldera server process.

**Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

The primary and recommended solution is to upgrade MITRE Caldera to a patched version that includes commit 35bc06e or later.  However, if immediate patching is not feasible, the following mitigation strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Upgrade Caldera:**
    *   The **most effective** remediation is to upgrade MITRE Caldera to a version that includes the fix for this vulnerability.  Ensure the upgrade is performed according to the official Caldera documentation.  This should be version 5.0.0, and should be verified to be using a commit ID equal to or higher than 35bc06e.

2.  **Network Segmentation:**
    *   Isolate the Caldera server within a segmented network. Restrict network access to only authorized systems and users.  This limits the blast radius if the server is compromised. Consider using a firewall to further restrict access.

3.  **Input Validation (if possible - may require code changes):**
    *   If modifying the Caldera code is an option, implement strict input validation on the parameters passed to the agent compilation API.  Specifically, rigorously sanitize and validate the content of the `gcc -extldflags` flag.  Blacklist potentially dangerous characters and commands.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Caldera server. Configure the WAF to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit the vulnerability.  Specifically, create rules to identify requests containing potentially malicious content within the `-extldflags` parameter.

5.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   Deploy Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to the vulnerability.  Configure the IDS/IPS to generate alerts and block potentially malicious requests.

6.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure the Caldera server process runs with the least privileges necessary to perform its functions.  Avoid running the server as a privileged user (e.g., root).

7.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Enable comprehensive logging on the Caldera server and monitor the logs for suspicious activity.  Pay particular attention to logs related to the agent compilation API.

8. **Disable Agent Compilation (If possible, and risk can be assessed and tolerated):**
    *   If the functionality of dynamically compiling agents is not essential to your use case, consider disabling it entirely. This eliminates the vulnerable code path.

**Testing and Validation:**

After implementing the remediation or mitigation strategies, thoroughly test the Caldera server to ensure that the vulnerability has been addressed.  This may involve attempting to exploit the vulnerability with a controlled exploit and verifying that the mitigations prevent the exploit from succeeding.

**Ongoing Monitoring:**

Continuously monitor the Caldera server and network for signs of compromise.  Regularly review logs, security alerts, and other relevant data to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.  Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and security updates for Caldera and other related software.
