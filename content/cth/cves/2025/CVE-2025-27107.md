## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-27107: Integrated Scripting Arbitrary Code Execution

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for the vulnerability described in the provided security advisory regarding Integrated Scripting, a tool used for creating scripts in Integrated Dynamics for Minecraft.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary Code Execution
*   **Component:** Integrated Scripting (Integrated Dynamics Minecraft mod)
*   **Affected Versions:** Integrated Scripting versions prior to:
    *   1.21.1-1.0.17
    *   1.21.4-1.0.9-254
    *   1.20.1-1.0.13
    *   1.19.2-1.0.10
*   **Description:**  The vulnerability allows a malicious user with the ability to create and use Integrated Scripting Variable Cards to bypass the JavaScript sandbox and execute arbitrary Java code on the Minecraft server.  This is achieved by leveraging Java reflection on a thrown exception object to construct arbitrary Java classes and invoke arbitrary Java methods.  This, in turn, can be used to execute arbitrary native code, such as via `java.lang.Runtime.exec`.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (High) - According to the provided data.
*   **Severity Rating:** High
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Minecraft server. An attacker can gain full control of the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of game world, denial of service, and potentially access to the underlying system if the Minecraft server is running with elevated privileges.

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   Yes, a working exploit exists. The advisory explicitly states that it's possible to escape the JavaScript sandbox using Java reflection on a thrown exception object from a Variable Card. This allows for constructing and invoking arbitrary Java classes and methods.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary and most effective remediation strategy is to **update the Integrated Scripting mod to a patched version.**

*   **Action:**  Immediately update the Integrated Scripting mod on all Minecraft servers running vulnerable versions.
*   **Target Versions:** Update to one of the following versions or later:
    *   1.21.1-1.0.17
    *   1.21.4-1.0.9-254
    *   1.20.1-1.0.13
    *   1.19.2-1.0.10
*   **Procedure:** Follow the mod update procedure specific to your Minecraft server setup (e.g., using a mod manager).  Ensure you back up your server data before performing the update.
*   **Testing:**  After updating, test the server functionality to ensure the mod update did not introduce any unexpected issues.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (If Update is Not Immediately Possible):**

If updating the Integrated Scripting mod is not immediately feasible, the following mitigation strategies can reduce the risk, though they are not a substitute for patching:

*   **Disable Integrated Scripting Variable Cards (Highest Priority):** This is the most effective workaround. If possible, disable the functionality of creating and using Integrated Scripting Variable Cards. This can often be done via configuration settings within the Integrated Dynamics mod or through server-side plugins that restrict access to specific mod features.
*   **Restrict Access to Integrated Scripting Features:** Limit which players or groups of players have permissions to use Integrated Scripting features.  Only trusted players should be able to create and use Variable Cards. This can be achieved through server permission systems.
*   **Monitor Server Logs:**  Actively monitor server logs for suspicious activity.  Look for unusual exceptions related to Java reflection, particularly those originating from Integrated Scripting.  Implement logging and alerting rules to flag potentially malicious activity.
*   **Implement Network Segmentation:** If possible, isolate the Minecraft server from other critical systems on the network.  This can limit the impact of a successful exploit.
*   **Apply Resource Limits:**  Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Minecraft server process. This might make exploiting the vulnerability more difficult or less impactful.

**6.  Communication:**

*   **Inform Players:**  Communicate the vulnerability and the mitigation steps being taken to the server players.  Explain any changes in functionality (e.g., disabling Variable Cards).
*   **Internal Communication:**  Inform all server administrators and relevant technical staff about the vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation plan.

**7.  Long-Term Recommendations:**

*   **Automated Patch Management:**  Implement an automated system for checking for and applying mod updates to Minecraft servers.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Minecraft server setup, including mods and server configuration.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to all accounts and processes running on the server.
*   **Stay Informed:**  Subscribe to security advisories from the Integrated Dynamics mod developers and other relevant sources.

**8.  Disclaimer:**

These remediation and mitigation strategies are provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered a complete security solution.  It is essential to assess the specific risks and environment of your Minecraft server and implement appropriate security measures.  Updating the Integrated Scripting mod is the most effective way to address the vulnerability.
