## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-32020 - SQL Injection in crud-query-parser

**Vulnerability Description:** SQL Injection in the `crud-query-parser` library specifically affecting users of the TypeORM adapter. The vulnerability lies in the improper neutralization of the `order/sort` parameter when constructing database queries, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Severity:** Critical (CVSS v3 Score: 9.3)

**Known Exploit:** Attackers can manipulate the `order/sort` parameter in HTTP requests to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or even unauthorized access to the database server. This exploit is viable if ordering is enabled in your application, a TypeORM adapter is in use, and a property filter has not been implemented.

**Remediation:**

1.  **Upgrade `crud-query-parser`:**  Immediately upgrade to version `0.1.0` or later. This version contains the fix for the SQL injection vulnerability.

        npm install crud-query-parser@latest
    # OR
    yarn add crud-query-parser@latest
    
2.  **Implement Property Filter:** Even after upgrading, implement a property filter to explicitly define the allowed fields for ordering/sorting. This provides an additional layer of security and limits the scope of potential injection attacks if future vulnerabilities are discovered.

    *   Refer to the `crud-query-parser` documentation for implementing a property filter specific to your application's data model and the TypeORM adapter.
    *   Ensure that the filter allows only trusted and well-defined fields to be used for ordering.

**Mitigation (if immediate upgrade is not possible):**

1.  **Disable Ordering Temporarily:** If an immediate upgrade is not feasible, temporarily disable the `order/sort` feature in your application to prevent exploitation. This will limit functionality, but mitigates the risk of SQL injection.

2.  **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the `order/sort` parameter before it is used to construct the database query. This should include:

    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Only allow specific, known-safe characters and field names.
    *   **Escaping:** Properly escape any user-provided data to prevent SQL injection. Be aware that escaping alone may not be sufficient, and a whitelist approach is strongly recommended.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rule:** Deploy a WAF rule to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in the `order/sort` parameter.  Configure the WAF to inspect the contents of the request and block any requests containing suspicious SQL syntax or keywords.

4.  **Database Permissions:** Ensure that the database user account used by your application has the least necessary privileges.  Limit its access to only the required tables and operations to minimize the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

**Verification:**

*   After implementing the remediation or mitigation steps, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the SQL injection vulnerability has been resolved and that the `order/sort` functionality is working as expected (if not disabled).
*   Use penetration testing tools to simulate attack scenarios and verify the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.
*   Continuously monitor your application for any suspicious activity or attempts to exploit the vulnerability.
