## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-27092 - GHOSTS Path Traversal Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation strategy for CVE-2025-27092, a path traversal vulnerability discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal
*   **Affected Software:** GHOSTS (open source user simulation framework)
*   **Affected Version:** 8.0.0.0
*   **Location of Vulnerability:** `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint
*   **Description:** The `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint, intended for serving profile photos for NPCs, fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths provided via the `photoLink` value during NPC creation.  By crafting a `photoLink` value containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`), an attacker can access files outside of the intended photo directory.  This allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** High. Allows attackers to read sensitive system files, including configuration files, credentials, and other potentially sensitive data.
    *   **Integrity:** Low. Does not directly allow for modification of files.
    *   **Availability:** Low. Does not directly lead to denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.  The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the HTTP API.
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low.  Exploitation is relatively straightforward as it involves crafting a specific request with a malicious path.

**3. Known Exploits:**

*   The provided advisory indicates that the vulnerability is easily exploitable with a specially crafted `photoLink` value.  Specifically, a path traversal sequence such as `../` can be injected.
*   Example Attack:

    1.  Create an NPC with a `photoLink` value set to `../../../../etc/passwd`.
    2.  Access the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint for the created NPC.
    3.  The server, due to the path traversal vulnerability, would return the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file (or any other accessible file based on the permissions of the web application process).

**4. Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

*   **Primary Remediation:** **Upgrade to GHOSTS version 8.2.7.90 or later.** This version contains a fix that properly validates and sanitizes file paths, preventing path traversal attacks.
*   **Timeline:**  **Immediate Upgrade Recommended.**  Due to the high severity and ease of exploitation, the upgrade should be prioritized and completed as quickly as possible.

**5. Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Backup:** Before performing any upgrade, create a full backup of the GHOSTS application and its data. This will allow for restoration in case of any issues during the upgrade process.
2.  **Upgrade GHOSTS:** Follow the official upgrade instructions provided by the GHOSTS developers to upgrade to version 8.2.7.90 or later. Ensure that all components of the application are upgraded.
3.  **Validation:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint to ensure that the vulnerability has been successfully remediated.  Attempt to create NPCs with malicious `photoLink` values and verify that the application properly handles the input and prevents access to unauthorized files.
4.  **Monitor:** Continuously monitor the GHOSTS application for any suspicious activity or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.  Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious requests.

**6.  Workarounds (If Upgrading Immediately is Not Possible - *Not Recommended*):**

*   **The advisory states that there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability other than upgrading.** Therefore, upgrading is the only recommended course of action. Relying on other methods without applying the patch will leave the system vulnerable.

**7. Communication:**

*   Communicate the vulnerability and the required remediation steps to all relevant stakeholders, including system administrators, developers, and security teams.
*   Document the remediation process and any issues encountered.

**8. Long-Term Prevention:**

*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Enforce secure coding practices during development to prevent similar vulnerabilities from being introduced in the future.  This includes proper input validation, output encoding, and using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the GHOSTS application and its dependencies.
*   **Stay Updated:** Stay informed about security advisories and updates for GHOSTS and its dependencies, and promptly apply patches and upgrades when they become available.

**9.  Post-Remediation Actions:**

*   Perform a vulnerability scan to confirm the vulnerability has been resolved.
*   Retest the application to verify the fix.
*   Monitor logs for any suspicious activity that might indicate attempted exploitation.

This remediation strategy is based on the information provided in the security advisory.  It is recommended to consult the official GHOSTS documentation and security advisories for the most up-to-date information and guidance.
