## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-30846

**Vulnerability:** PHP Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Description:** The `jetmonsters Restaurant Menu by MotoPress` plugin, versions up to 2.4.4, suffers from a PHP Local File Inclusion vulnerability. This is due to improper control of filename parameters used in include/require statements within the PHP code. An attacker can manipulate these parameters to include and execute arbitrary local files on the server.

**Severity:** High (CVSS: 8.8)

**Known Exploit:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious requests that modify the filename parameter to point to sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, log files, or even PHP files containing sensitive information. The attacker can then execute arbitrary PHP code if they can upload a malicious PHP file to the server or if a vulnerable PHP file already exists.

**Remediation:**

*   **Upgrade:** The primary remediation is to **upgrade the `jetmonsters Restaurant Menu by MotoPress` plugin to a version greater than 2.4.4.** The vendor has likely released a patch addressing this vulnerability in a later version.

**Mitigation:**

If upgrading is not immediately possible, implement the following mitigations:

*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all filename parameters used in include/require statements. Sanitize the input to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., preventing ".." sequences) and ensure that only expected characters are allowed.

*   **Path Restriction:** Restrict the paths allowed for inclusion to a whitelist of known safe directories. This can be achieved by configuring PHP's `open_basedir` setting to limit file access to specific directories.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and configure it with rules to detect and block attempts to exploit LFI vulnerabilities. The WAF should be able to identify malicious patterns in request parameters.

*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web server process runs with the least necessary privileges. This will limit the impact of a successful LFI exploit.

*   **File System Permissions:** Set appropriate file system permissions to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application.
