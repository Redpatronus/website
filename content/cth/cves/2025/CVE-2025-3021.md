## CVE-2025-3021: Path Traversal in e-solutions e-management

**Description:**

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the e-solutions e-management software. The `/downloadReport.php` endpoint, specifically the `file` parameter, is susceptible to malicious input that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory. By crafting a specific `file` parameter value, an attacker can potentially read sensitive system files, configuration files, or other confidential data.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to information disclosure of sensitive data.

**Known Exploit:**

Attackers can use the `file` parameter within the `/downloadReport.php` endpoint with path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate the file system outside of the expected directory and retrieve unauthorized files. For example, a crafted request might look like:

`/downloadReport.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd`

This could allow the attacker to read the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially leading to user enumeration and further exploitation.

**Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Action:**  Implement strict input validation on the `file` parameter within the `/downloadReport.php` endpoint.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Whitelist Approach:** Only allow a predefined set of valid filenames or paths.
        *   **Sanitization:** Remove or encode any path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) from the input.
        *   **Regular Expression:** Use a regular expression to ensure the input conforms to the expected file path format.
        *   **Canonicalization:** Convert the path to its canonical (absolute) form and compare it to allowed paths.

2.  **Path Restriction:**
    *   **Action:**  Restrict the access of the `downloadReport.php` script to only the designated directory containing the reports.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Chroot Jail:** Configure the web server to run the script in a chroot jail, limiting its access to only the designated directory.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Use ACLs to restrict the script's access to files outside the intended directory.

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure the web server process running the script has the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Details:** Avoid running the web server as a privileged user (e.g., root).  Grant the web server process only the permissions required to access the report files.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Action:** Deploy a WAF to detect and block path traversal attempts.
    *   **Details:** Configure the WAF with rules to identify and block requests containing path traversal sequences in the `file` parameter.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Details:**  Include path traversal vulnerabilities in the scope of security assessments.

6.  **Software Updates:**
    *   **Action:**  Apply any available patches or updates released by e-solutions for the e-management software.
    *   **Details:**  Monitor e-solutions' website and security advisories for updates addressing this vulnerability.

7.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **Action:** Implement secure error handling to avoid disclosing sensitive information.
    *   **Details:**  Avoid displaying full file paths in error messages. Log errors for debugging but sanitize sensitive information.
