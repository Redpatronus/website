## CVE-2025-2807: Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin Arbitrary Plugin Installation

**Description:**

The Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 1.4.64, is vulnerable to arbitrary plugin installations. The `mvl_setup_wizard_install_plugin()` function lacks a proper capability check.  This allows authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access (or higher) to install and activate arbitrary plugins on the affected WordPress site.  This can lead to remote code execution (RCE).

**Severity:**

*   CVSS Score: 8.8 (High)
*   Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Known Exploit:**

Authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a request to the `mvl_setup_wizard_install_plugin()` function, bypassing the missing capability check and specifying a malicious plugin to install.  Once the plugin is installed and activated, the attacker can achieve remote code execution by exploiting vulnerabilities within the newly installed plugin.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Update:**  Update the Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin to the latest version (greater than 1.4.64) as soon as possible. This update contains a fix for the missing capability check.

2.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:** Implement or update WAF rules to detect and block requests to the `mvl_setup_wizard_install_plugin()` function from unauthorized users or requests that attempt to install plugins. This can act as a temporary mitigation until the plugin is updated.

3.  **User Role Review:** Review and restrict user roles, especially for Subscriber-level users and above. Reduce permissions to the bare minimum required for legitimate user activity. If possible, restrict plugin installation capabilities to Administrator-level users only.

4.  **Monitor Plugin Integrity:** Regularly monitor the installed plugins for any unauthorized or unexpected additions.  Use a plugin integrity monitoring tool to detect changes in plugin files.

5.  **Security Audit:** Perform a comprehensive security audit of the WordPress site, including a review of all plugins and themes, to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.

6.  **Incident Response Plan:** Develop or update an incident response plan in case the vulnerability is exploited.  This plan should include steps for isolating the affected system, identifying the scope of the compromise, and restoring the system to a secure state.

7.  **Disable Plugin (If Possible):** If the Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin is not essential, consider temporarily disabling it until it can be updated. This will eliminate the vulnerability.
