## CVE-2025-26701: Percona PMM Server Default Credentials Vulnerability

### Description

This vulnerability affects Percona PMM Server (OVA) versions prior to 3.0.0-1.ova.  It stems from the use of default service account credentials that are configured out-of-the-box.  An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can gain SSH access, escalate privileges to root via Sudo, and ultimately expose sensitive data.

### Severity

* **CVSS v3 Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
* **CVSS v3 Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **Explanation:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to gain complete control of the system with no user interaction or prior authentication required.  This leads to a high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

### Known Exploits

While specific exploit code might not be publicly available yet (due to the relatively recent discovery date), the nature of the vulnerability (default credentials) makes it highly exploitable.  An attacker only needs to:

1. **Identify a vulnerable Percona PMM Server (OVA) instance.** This can be done through banner grabbing or vulnerability scanning.
2. **Attempt to authenticate using the default service account credentials.**
3. **Once authenticated, leverage SSH access to execute commands and escalate privileges using Sudo.**

Given the simplicity of the attack, it's highly likely that automated exploitation tools will be developed and deployed rapidly.

### Remediation / Mitigation Strategy

The primary and recommended remediation is to upgrade to a secure version of Percona PMM Server.

**1. Upgrade Percona PMM Server:**

* **Immediate Action:**  Upgrade to one of the following versions:
    * PMM2 2.42.0-1.ova or later (including 2.43.0-1.ova, 2.43.1-1.ova, 2.43.2-1.ova, and 2.44.0-1.ova)
    * PMM3 3.0.0-1.ova or later.
* **Procedure:** Follow the official Percona PMM Server upgrade documentation.  Ensure you back up your PMM Server instance before upgrading.
* **Verification:** After the upgrade, verify the version number of the PMM Server to ensure the upgrade was successful.

**2. If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible (Temporary Mitigation):**

If upgrading is not immediately feasible, implement the following temporary mitigation steps.  **Note:** These steps are NOT a replacement for upgrading.

* **Change Default Credentials:**
    * **Identify the Default Accounts:** Consult Percona's documentation or the default PMM OVA configuration to identify the service accounts with default credentials.  (e.g., ssh user, database user, etc.)
    * **Change Passwords:**  Immediately change the passwords for *all* default service accounts to strong, unique passwords.  Use a password manager to generate and securely store these passwords.  Ensure the passwords meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, mixed-case, special characters, numbers).  Change passwords both at the OS level and within any databases or applications configured with the default credentials.
* **Network Segmentation:**
    * **Restrict Access:**  Isolate the PMM Server on a secure network segment.  Implement firewall rules to restrict access to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
    * **Limit Exposure:**  Minimize the number of systems that can communicate directly with the PMM Server.
* **Disable SSH (If Feasible):**
    * **Assess Impact:**  Carefully evaluate the impact of disabling SSH access on the PMM Server's functionality.  If disabling SSH does not negatively impact monitoring or management tasks, disable SSH access entirely.
* **Monitoring and Intrusion Detection:**
    * **Implement Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring solutions to detect suspicious activity, such as:
        * Failed login attempts
        * Unauthorized access attempts
        * Privilege escalation attempts
        * Unusual network traffic
    * **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to detect and alert on potential intrusions.  Configure the IDS to specifically monitor for attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Regular Audits:**
    * **Review Access Logs:** Regularly review access logs for any suspicious activity.
    * **Periodic Security Assessments:** Schedule regular security assessments to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

**3. Post-Remediation Steps:**

* **Verification:** After upgrading or implementing mitigations, perform thorough testing to ensure the vulnerability is no longer exploitable.
* **Documentation:** Document all remediation and mitigation steps taken.
* **Communication:** Communicate the findings and remediation steps to relevant stakeholders.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the PMM Server for any signs of compromise or suspicious activity.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Default Credentials Are A Risk:** Always change default credentials immediately after deploying any new system or application.
* **Layered Security:** Implement a layered security approach to protect against multiple threats.
* **Stay Informed:**  Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Percona PMM Server to stay informed of any new vulnerabilities or security best practices.

This remediation strategy aims to address the CVE-2025-26701 vulnerability and minimize the risk of exploitation. It is crucial to prioritize upgrading to a patched version of Percona PMM Server for long-term security. Remember that these mitigation steps are temporary and do not provide the same level of protection as a software update.
