## Remediation / Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-30473

**Vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') in Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider.

**Description:**  Authenticated users can inject arbitrary SQL commands via the `partition_clause` parameter in the `SQLTableCheckOperator` when triggering a DAG. This allows them to escalate privileges and execute commands they wouldn't normally have access to. The vulnerability occurs because the `partition_clause` input isn't properly sanitized, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected and executed by the Airflow instance.

**Severity:** High (CVSS Score 8.8)

**Known Exploit:**  An authenticated user, possessing the ability to trigger DAGs, can inject malicious SQL code into the `partition_clause` parameter of an `SQLTableCheckOperator`. This injected SQL code will be executed by the Airflow system, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access to data, system resources, or the ability to modify data and infrastructure.

**Remediation:**

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider to version 1.24.1 or later. This version contains the fix for the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Verify:** After upgrading, verify that the vulnerable code paths involving the `SQLTableCheckOperator` and `partition_clause` are no longer susceptible to SQL injection attacks.  Test with known SQL injection payloads (without actually compromising the system) to confirm the fix is effective.

**Mitigation (If Immediate Upgrade is Not Possible):**

*   **Restrict Access:** Limit user access to DAG triggering, especially for DAGs that utilize the `SQLTableCheckOperator` with user-supplied `partition_clause`. Only authorized personnel should have the ability to trigger these DAGs.
*   **Input Validation:** If possible without significantly modifying functionality before an upgrade, implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `partition_clause` parameter.  Use a whitelist approach to only allow approved characters and SQL syntax.  Blacklisting is not recommended as it is easily bypassed.  However, it is strongly recommended to apply the upgrade fix.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting for suspicious SQL queries or database access patterns.  Look for unusual or unexpected SQL syntax within the `partition_clause` parameter or queries originating from the Airflow service account.
*   **Code Review:** Perform a thorough code review of all DAGs that utilize the `SQLTableCheckOperator` to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Look for instances where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the Airflow service account has the minimum necessary privileges to perform its required tasks.  Avoid granting unnecessary database privileges to the Airflow service account.
