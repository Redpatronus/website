## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-29390

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection in the `set_password` function within `application/controllers/home.php` of jerryhanjj ERP 1.0.

**Severity:** High (CVSS Score: 8.8)

**Known Exploit:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the `set_password` function. This could allow the attacker to:

*   Bypass authentication.
*   Read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.
*   Potentially gain full control over the ERP system depending on the database user privileges.

**Remediation/Mitigation Steps:**

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Description:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied input used in the `set_password` function, specifically the data that will be used in a database query.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) with placeholders for user-supplied data. This prevents the database from interpreting the data as code.  This is the preferred method.
        *   If parameterized queries are not feasible, thoroughly sanitize user input.  Apply escaping functions specific to the database being used (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string()` for MySQL) to escape special characters that could be used in SQL injection attacks.
        *   Implement whitelisting of allowed characters and data formats. Reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.

2.  **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Description:** Ensure the database user account used by the ERP application has only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Avoid using database administrator accounts for the application's database connection.
        *   Grant only `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges on the necessary tables.  Do not grant `CREATE`, `DROP`, or other administrative privileges.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Description:** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Configure the WAF with rules to identify and block common SQL injection patterns.
        *   Regularly update the WAF rules to protect against newly discovered attack vectors.

4.  **Code Review and Security Audits:**
    *   **Description:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of the `set_password` function and other areas of the application that handle user input.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Engage security experts to perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

5.  **Regular Security Patching:**
    *   **Description:** Implement a process for regularly applying security patches and updates to the ERP system and its underlying components (e.g., operating system, web server, database server).
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for new threats.
        *   Test patches in a non-production environment before deploying them to production.

6.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **Description:** Implement proper error handling to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in error messages.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users.
        *   Log errors to a secure location for analysis by administrators.

7.  **Upgrade to a Secure Version:**
    *   **Description:** If a patched version of jerryhanjj ERP is available, upgrade to that version immediately. This is the most effective long-term solution.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Follow the vendor's instructions for upgrading the ERP system.
        *   Thoroughly test the upgraded system to ensure that it functions correctly and that the vulnerability has been resolved.

**Priority:** High.  Due to the severity of the vulnerability and the potential for significant impact, these steps should be implemented as soon as possible.

**Testing:**  After implementing the remediation steps, conduct thorough testing to verify that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed. This should include:

*   Manual testing with various SQL injection payloads.
*   Automated vulnerability scanning.
*   Penetration testing by a qualified security professional.
