## Vulnerability Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-30658

**Description:** Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series devices.  Specific HTTP content within a server's response can cause Juniper Buffers (jbufs) to be queued but never released, leading to exhaustion of jbufs and a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.

**Severity:** High (CVSS v3.1 Score: 8.7)

**Known Exploit:** An unauthenticated, network-based attacker can send crafted HTTP traffic to trigger the jbuf leak and exhaust device resources, leading to complete disruption of traffic forwarding.

**Remediation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Action:**
    *   **Identify Affected Devices:** Determine all SRX Series devices running Junos OS and confirm if Anti-Virus is enabled.

2.  **Apply Software Patch:**
    *   **Upgrade Junos OS:** Upgrade to a fixed software version as soon as possible. The following versions and later are *not* affected:
        *   21.2R3-S9
        *   21.4R3-S10
        *   22.2R3-S6
        *   22.4R3-S6
        *   23.2R2-S3
        *   23.4R2-S3
        *   24.2R2-S3 (This is the minimum version to be installed. Versions higher than this would also address the vulnerability)
    *   **Testing:** Before deploying to production, thoroughly test the upgrade in a lab environment to ensure compatibility and stability.

3.  **Monitoring and Detection:**
    *   **Log Monitoring:** Implement proactive monitoring for jbuf utilization levels.  Specifically, monitor for the following log message:
                (<node>.)<fpc> Warning: jbuf pool id <#> utilization level (<current level>%) is above <threshold>%!
                Configure alerts to trigger when jbuf pool utilization exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80%).
    *   **Traffic Analysis:** Monitor network traffic for suspicious HTTP patterns that could indicate an attempted exploit.

4.  **Mitigation (If immediate patching is not possible):**
    *   **Disable Anti-Virus:**  As a temporary workaround, disable the Anti-Virus feature on SRX Series devices.  This will eliminate the vulnerability but remove Anti-Virus protection.

                **Note:** This will significantly reduce security posture and should only be used as a last resort until patching is possible.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on HTTP traffic to reduce the impact of a potential exploit.  This should be carefully configured to avoid impacting legitimate traffic.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF in front of critical web applications to detect and block malicious HTTP traffic.  Configure WAF rules to identify and block suspicious patterns.

5.  **Recovery:**
    *   **Reboot:** If the device experiences a DoS due to this vulnerability, a manual reboot is required to free the leaked jbufs and restore functionality.

**Communication:**

*   Communicate the vulnerability details and mitigation steps to all relevant personnel (network engineers, security team, system administrators).
*   Provide regular updates on the patching progress and any observed incidents.
