## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-30285

**Vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Description:** ColdFusion versions 2023.12, 2021.18, 2025.0 and earlier are affected by a deserialization vulnerability. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user by crafting a malicious serialized object. When the ColdFusion application deserializes this untrusted data, it can lead to code execution.

**Severity:** Critical (CVSS Score: 8.0)

**Known Exploit:** Exploitation requires user interaction. A victim must open a malicious file containing the crafted serialized object for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Remediation:**

*   **Apply Patch:** Immediately upgrade to the latest version of ColdFusion that addresses this vulnerability. Refer to Adobe's security bulletin for the appropriate patch for your specific ColdFusion version.

**Mitigation:**

*   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening files from untrusted sources. Emphasize the importance of verifying the sender and the file's authenticity before opening any attachments or downloaded files.

*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data. This can help prevent the injection of malicious serialized objects.

*   **Disable Deserialization (If Possible):** If deserialization is not a core function of the ColdFusion application, consider disabling it altogether. This is the most effective way to eliminate the risk.

*   **Restrict File Access:** Implement strict file access controls to limit the impact of a successful exploit. Ensure that the ColdFusion application runs with the least privileges necessary.

*   **Monitor System Activity:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect suspicious activity. Look for unusual process creations, network connections, or file modifications that could indicate an exploit attempt.

*   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the ColdFusion server from other critical systems on the network. This can help contain the damage if the server is compromised.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to inspect incoming traffic and block requests that contain malicious serialized objects. Configure the WAF with rules to detect and prevent deserialization attacks.
