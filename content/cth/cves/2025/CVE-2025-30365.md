## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-30365: SQL Injection in WeGIA

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-30365, a SQL Injection vulnerability identified in WeGIA versions prior to 3.2.8.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-30365
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA (Web manager for charitable institutions)
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 3.2.8
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Location:** `/WeGIA/html/socio/sistema/controller/query_geracao_auto.php?query=[MALICIOUS_SQL_CODE]` (specifically the `query` parameter)
*   **Description:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input in the `query` parameter of the specified endpoint.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query executed by the application.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)
*   **Severity Level:** Critical
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** High - An attacker can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database, including user information, financial records, and other confidential data.
    *   **Integrity:** High - An attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, data loss, and system instability.
    *   **Availability:** High - An attacker can potentially disrupt the availability of the application by causing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or by altering database structures.

**3. Known Exploits:**

*   **Exploitability:** The vulnerability is highly exploitable.  An attacker can craft a malicious URL with injected SQL code in the `query` parameter.  No authentication is mentioned in the original report, thus the exploitation can be unauthenticated.
*   **Examples of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to:
    *   Bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, financial information).
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server (depending on the database configuration and permissions).

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

*   **Immediate Action:**
    *   **Upgrade to Version 3.2.8 or Later:** The primary and recommended solution is to immediately upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.8 or a later version where the vulnerability has been fixed.
    *   **Take Offline (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible):** If an immediate upgrade is not possible, consider temporarily taking the affected application offline to prevent potential attacks until the upgrade can be performed.
*   **Long-Term Action (After Upgrade):**
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the application, focusing on areas where user input is used in database queries.  Pay particular attention to the `query_geracao_auto.php` file and the handling of the `query` parameter.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This includes:
        *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for user input.
        *   **Escaping:** Properly escape user input before including it in SQL queries. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible.
        *   **Encoding:** Encode user input to prevent it from being interpreted as SQL code.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This method separates the SQL code from the user-provided data, making it impossible for an attacker to inject malicious code.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges to perform its functions.  Avoid granting overly permissive privileges.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests, including those that attempt to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. Configure the WAF with specific rules to protect against SQL injection attacks targeting the WeGIA application.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Implement a regular security testing program, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible):**

If upgrading to version 3.2.8 is not immediately possible, the following mitigation steps can be taken to reduce the risk of exploitation:

*   **Input Validation on the Web Server:** Implement input validation on the web server (e.g., using mod_security for Apache or a similar module for other web servers) to filter out potentially malicious SQL injection attempts. This can provide an additional layer of defense.  However, rely on input validation alone is insufficient.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to limit the impact of a successful attack. Place the database server on a separate, isolated network segment.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Monitor application logs and database logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual database queries or access attempts.

**6. Communication Plan:**

*   **Inform Affected Users:**  Communicate with users of the WeGIA application about the vulnerability and the recommended remediation steps.
*   **Internal Communication:**  Inform relevant internal teams (e.g., IT, security, development) about the vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation plan.

**7. Timeline:**

*   **Upgrade to Version 3.2.8:** As soon as possible.
*   **Implement Mitigation Measures (If Upgrade Delayed):** Within 24-48 hours.
*   **Code Review and Input Validation:** Within 1 week.
*   **Implement WAF:** Within 2 weeks.
*   **Regular Security Testing:** Ongoing, at least quarterly.

**8. Responsible Parties:**

*   **[Name/Team]:** Responsible for upgrading the application.
*   **[Name/Team]:** Responsible for implementing input validation and sanitization.
*   **[Name/Team]:** Responsible for implementing the WAF.
*   **[Name/Team]:** Responsible for security testing.

This remediation/mitigation strategy should be reviewed and updated as needed.  Regularly assess the effectiveness of the implemented measures and adjust the strategy accordingly.
