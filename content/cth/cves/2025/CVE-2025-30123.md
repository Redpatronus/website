## CVE-2025-30123: Hardcoded FTP Credentials in ROADCAM X3 (Viidure APK)

**Description of Vulnerability:**

The ROADCAM X3 device, specifically the Viidure mobile application (APK), contains hardcoded FTP credentials for the `FTPX` user account. This allows unauthorized users to gain access to the device's FTP server.

**Severity:**

* **CVSS v3 Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
* **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **Explanation:**
    * **Attack Vector (AV:N):** Network - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
    * **Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Low - No special conditions or mitigating factors are required for exploitation.
    * **Privileges Required (PR:N):** None - No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    * **User Interaction (UI:N):** None - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    * **Scope (S:U):** Unchanged - The vulnerability affects the ROADCAM X3 device itself.
    * **Confidentiality (C:H):** High -  The attacker can access sensitive recorded footage.
    * **Integrity (I:H):** High - The attacker can modify or delete recorded footage.
    * **Availability (A:H):** High -  The attacker could potentially disrupt the recording functionality.

**Known Exploit:**

The hardcoded credentials in the Viidure APK are the exploit.  An attacker simply needs to:

1.  Obtain the Viidure APK.
2.  Decompile or reverse engineer the APK to extract the hardcoded FTP credentials (username and password for the `FTPX` user).
3.  Use an FTP client with the extracted credentials to connect to the ROADCAM X3 device and access the stored footage.

**Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

The primary goal is to eliminate the hardcoded credentials and prevent unauthorized access to the FTP server.

1.  **Immediate Action: Disable FTP Service (Short-Term Mitigation):**

    *   **Action:**  Disable the FTP service on the ROADCAM X3 devices until a permanent fix is available. This will prevent attackers from exploiting the vulnerability.
    *   **Implementation:**  This might require a remote configuration change pushed to devices or instructions to end-users on how to disable FTP through the device's settings (if available). Communicate the instructions clearly and provide support.
    *   **Impact:**  Disables the FTP functionality, which may affect users who rely on it for data transfer.

2.  **Permanent Solution: Software/Firmware Update (Long-Term Mitigation):**

    *   **Action:** Develop and release a software/firmware update that removes the hardcoded FTP credentials and implements a more secure authentication mechanism.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Remove Hardcoded Credentials:**  Completely remove the hardcoded `FTPX` account and any associated credentials from the APK and the device's firmware.
        *   **Implement Secure Authentication:**  Replace the hardcoded credentials with a more secure authentication method. Consider options like:
            *   **Unique User Accounts:**  Generate unique user accounts for each device with strong, randomly generated passwords.
            *   **User-Configurable Credentials:**  Allow users to set their own FTP credentials via the mobile application or device settings.
            *   **Secure Protocols:**  Transition from FTP to more secure protocols like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure), which encrypt data in transit. These protocols typically require certificates or SSH keys for authentication.
            *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Implement ACLs to restrict FTP access based on IP address or other criteria.
        *   **Secure Storage:**  If credentials must be stored on the device, use secure storage mechanisms like encryption with hardware-backed key storage to protect them from unauthorized access.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code to ensure that no other hardcoded credentials or vulnerabilities exist.
    *   **Deployment:**
        *   **Over-the-Air (OTA) Update:**  Preferably, deploy the update OTA to all affected devices. This will require a robust update mechanism.
        *   **Manual Update:**  If OTA update is not possible, provide clear and easy-to-follow instructions for users to manually update their devices.
    *   **Testing:** Rigorously test the updated software/firmware to ensure that the vulnerability is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
    *   **Communication:**  Communicate the update availability to all users of ROADCAM X3 devices and emphasize the importance of installing the update to protect their data.

3.  **Mobile App Security Hardening:**

    *   **Action:**  Implement security best practices for mobile app development to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Code Obfuscation:**  Obfuscate the code in the APK to make it more difficult to reverse engineer and extract sensitive information.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the source code.
        *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Perform dynamic analysis to test the app's behavior and identify runtime vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the mobile application to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure Data Storage:** Implement secure data storage mechanisms to protect sensitive data stored on the device.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Secure Communication:**  Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS to protect data transmitted between the app and the server.

4.  **Credential Rotation (For future scenarios):**

    *   **Action:** Implement a mechanism for rotating credentials regularly to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.  This doesn't directly address this specific vulnerability after patching, but it's a good general security practice.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Automate the process of generating and distributing new credentials.
        *   Define a clear policy for credential rotation.

**Timeline:**

*   **Immediate (within 24 hours):** Disable FTP service.
*   **Short-Term (within 1-2 weeks):** Develop and release an interim update with enhanced logging and monitoring to detect exploitation attempts.
*   **Long-Term (within 4-8 weeks):** Develop and release a permanent software/firmware update that removes the hardcoded credentials and implements a more secure authentication mechanism.

**Communication:**

*   Inform users about the vulnerability and the steps they need to take to protect their devices.
*   Provide clear and concise instructions on how to disable FTP and install the software/firmware update.
*   Maintain open communication with users and address their concerns promptly.

By implementing these remediation and mitigation strategies, the risk associated with CVE-2025-30123 can be significantly reduced.
