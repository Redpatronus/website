## CVE-2025-26689: CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) Forced Browsing Vulnerability

**Description:**

A "Forced Browsing" (Direct Request) vulnerability exists in CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) all versions. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the device.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*   **Privileges Required:** None
*   **User Interaction:** None
*   **Scope:** Changed (Impacts other components)
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** High
*   **Integrity Impact:** High
*   **Availability Impact:** High

**Known Exploit:**

A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the product. Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   Obtaining sensitive product data.
*   Deleting product data.
*   Altering product settings.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

The following steps should be taken to remediate or mitigate this vulnerability:

1.  **Immediate Action: Disconnect Device (If Possible):** As a first step, if feasible and practical, temporarily disconnect the CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) device from the network to prevent potential exploitation. Evaluate operational impact before taking this step.

2.  **Apply Patch (If Available):**
    *   Check the vendor's website (CHOCO TEI) or contact their support for available firmware updates or patches that address this vulnerability (CVE-2025-26689).
    *   Apply the patch immediately according to the vendor's instructions.
    *   Verify the patch application was successful.

3.  **Implement Network Segmentation:**
    *   Isolate the CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) device on a separate network segment with strict access controls.
    *   Limit network access to the device to only authorized users and systems.
    *   Implement firewall rules to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic to/from the device.

4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   The vendor needs to implement proper input validation and sanitization on the device's web interface and API endpoints. This will prevent attackers from injecting malicious code or manipulating HTTP requests.

5.  **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   If possible, enable strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) for accessing the device's web interface and API.
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user access to only necessary functionalities.

6.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**
    *   Configure your network's IDS/IPS to detect and block malicious HTTP requests targeting the CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) device.
    *   Develop or use existing signatures that can identify exploitation attempts of CVE-2025-26689.

7.  **Monitor Device Activity:**
    *   Implement monitoring solutions to track the device's network traffic and system logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Regularly review logs for anomalies that may indicate a compromise.

8.  **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the network to identify and address other potential security weaknesses.
    *   Include the CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) device in your regular scanning schedule.

9. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * If feasible, deploy a WAF to filter malicious HTTP requests before they reach the CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) device.

10. **Contact Vendor for Support:**
    * Reach out to CHOCO TEI support to report the vulnerability and request assistance with patching and securing the device.

**Long-Term Strategy:**

*   **Vendor Engagement:**  Work with CHOCO TEI to ensure they implement a robust security development lifecycle (SDL) and regularly conduct security testing on their products.
*   **Device Replacement:** If patching or mitigation is not feasible, consider replacing the vulnerable device with a more secure alternative.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate users about the risks of using vulnerable devices and the importance of following security best practices.

**Note:** These recommendations are based on the information provided and general security best practices.  The specific steps required may vary depending on your environment and the vendor's guidance.  Prioritize actions based on risk assessment and business impact.
