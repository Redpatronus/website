## Vulnerability Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-29997

**Vulnerability ID:** CVE-2025-29997

**Reported By:** Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) - vdisclose@cert-in.org.in

**Affected System:** CAP back office application

**Date Reported:** 2025-03-13

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

This vulnerability is related to **improper authorization checks** in the CAP back office application.  Specifically, certain API endpoints lack sufficient validation to ensure that a user making a request is authorized to access the requested resource. This allows an authenticated attacker to potentially bypass access controls.

**2. Severity:**

* **CVSS Score:** 8.2 (High)

Based on the CVSS score, this vulnerability is considered **HIGH** severity. Exploitation could lead to significant data breaches and compromise of user accounts.  The ability to access other user accounts without authorization represents a substantial risk.

**3. Known Exploit:**

An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by **manipulating API request URLs** to gain unauthorized access to other user accounts.  This likely involves modifying parameters within the URL (e.g., user ID, account number) to target accounts the attacker should not have access to.
The report indicates that the attack is straightforward to execute with a AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N vector which translates to: Network Access, Low Complexity, Low Privileges Required, No User Interaction Required, No Scope Change, Confidentiality: High, Integrity: None, Availability: None.

**4. Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

The following steps should be taken to remediate and mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2025-29997:

* **A. Code Review and Access Control Implementation (Immediate Action):**
    * **Perform a thorough code review of all API endpoints** within the CAP back office application, focusing on authentication and authorization logic.
    * **Implement robust authorization checks** at each API endpoint. This should include verifying that the user making the request has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource based on their role and the specific resource being accessed.  *Do not rely solely on authentication; authorization is critical.*
    * **Adopt a "least privilege" approach:**  Users should only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions.
    * **Specifically validate all input parameters**, ensuring that the user is authorized to access the resource identified by those parameters.  This includes user IDs, account numbers, and any other identifier that could be used to target specific resources.

* **B.  API Security Hardening (Short-Term Action):**
    * **Implement input validation** to prevent malicious data from being injected into API requests.
    * **Consider using a centralized authorization framework** (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) to manage access control policies consistently across the application.
    * **Implement rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attempts to guess valid user IDs or other sensitive parameters.
    * **Implement logging and auditing** to track API access attempts and identify suspicious activity.

* **C.  Testing and Validation (Ongoing Action):**
    * **Conduct penetration testing** to verify that the implemented access controls are effective in preventing unauthorized access.
    * **Perform regular security audits** of the CAP back office application to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Establish a secure development lifecycle (SDLC)** that incorporates security considerations throughout the software development process.
    * **Implement automated security testing** as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

* **D.  Monitoring and Incident Response (Ongoing Action):**
    * **Monitor API logs** for suspicious activity, such as attempts to access resources outside of a user's authorized scope.
    * **Establish an incident response plan** to quickly address any security breaches that may occur.

**5. Prioritization:**

Remediation of this vulnerability should be considered **high priority** due to the potential for unauthorized access to user accounts and the high CVSS score.  Address the "Immediate Action" items as soon as possible.

**6. Reporting and Communication:**

* Keep CERT-In informed of the progress of remediation efforts.
* Communicate the vulnerability and remediation steps to relevant stakeholders, including developers, system administrators, and security personnel.

By implementing these remediation and mitigation strategies, the risk associated with CVE-2025-29997 can be significantly reduced. Remember to continuously monitor the system for signs of exploitation and adapt the security measures as needed.
