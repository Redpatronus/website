## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-30066 - tj-actions changed-files Secrets Exposure

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-30066, affecting the `tj-actions/changed-files` GitHub Action.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-30066
*   **Affected Component:** `tj-actions/changed-files` GitHub Action (versions up to and including 45.0.7) - specifically, versions v1 through v45.0.7 were *modified* by a threat actor.
*   **Description:** The `tj-actions/changed-files` GitHub Action, in compromised versions, allows remote attackers to discover secrets by reading action logs. The original vulnerability was not in the listed tagged versions. A threat actor maliciously modified the tags v1-v45.0.7 to point at a commit (0e58ed8) containing malicious code (`updateFeatures`). This malicious code likely exfiltrated sensitive information (secrets) from the GitHub Actions environment.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
*   **Rationale:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized remote access (AV:N), requires no special access conditions (AC:L), needs no user interaction (UI:N), is scoped as unchanged (S:U), results in high confidentiality impact (C:H), no integrity impact (I:N), and no availability impact (A:N).  The exposure of secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, unauthorized access to systems, and financial loss.

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by a malicious commit (0e58ed8) that was fraudulently associated with existing tags (v1 through v45.0.7).
*   The `updateFeatures` code within this commit likely contains logic to extract secrets available in the GitHub Actions environment and transmit them to an attacker-controlled server.
*   Specifically, the attacker likely targeted environment variables, files, and other data accessible during workflow execution.

**4. Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

This strategy is divided into immediate actions and preventative measures.

**A. Immediate Actions (Critical):**

1.  **Identify and Stop Use of Affected Action Versions:**

    *   **Action:** Immediately cease using the `tj-actions/changed-files` action in *any* GitHub Actions workflows.
    *   **How:**  Review all GitHub Actions workflows in your repositories, searching for any instance of `uses: tj-actions/changed-files@<version>`.  Disable or comment out those workflow steps that include this vulnerable Action.

2.  **Audit GitHub Actions Logs for Secret Exposure:**

    *   **Action:**  Thoroughly examine the logs of all GitHub Actions workflows that previously used the affected `tj-actions/changed-files` action.  Specifically, look for signs of unusual network activity, unexpected file accesses, or output of sensitive data to the logs (even if masked by GitHub).
    *   **How:** Manually review logs, and if feasible, consider using scripting to search for patterns indicative of secret exposure (e.g., base64 encoded strings, API key patterns).  Be aware that attackers may have tried to obfuscate the exfiltration process.

3.  **Rotate Potentially Compromised Secrets:**

    *   **Action:** **This is the most critical step.** Assume that any secrets that were accessible within workflows using the compromised action versions *have been* compromised. Immediately rotate *all* such secrets.
    *   **How:**
        *   Identify all API keys, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive credentials used by the workflows.
        *   Revoke or invalidate the existing credentials.
        *   Generate new credentials and securely store them (e.g., using GitHub Secrets, a secrets management system).
        *   Update all applications and services that rely on these credentials to use the new values.

4.  **Review Access Permissions:**

    *   **Action:**  Check the access permissions granted to the GitHub Actions workflows that used the affected action.  Ensure that only the necessary permissions are granted (Principle of Least Privilege).
    *   **How:** Review the `permissions:` section in the YAML files for your GitHub Actions workflows.  Look for overly permissive settings (e.g., `contents: write`, `packages: write` when read-only access is sufficient).

**B. Preventative Measures (Long-Term):**

1.  **Pin Action Versions to Specific Commits (Recommended):**

    *   **Action:**  Instead of using tag-based versions (e.g., `@v45.0.7`), pin your GitHub Actions to a specific, immutable commit SHA.  This prevents malicious actors from manipulating tags to point to compromised code.
    *   **How:**  Find the specific commit SHA you want to use (e.g., the commit for a known-good version).  Use the commit SHA in your workflow file: `uses: tj-actions/changed-files@<commit-sha>`.  Be aware that this means you will not receive automatic updates, so monitoring for updates and manually updating the SHA when necessary is critical.

2.  **Monitor GitHub Security Advisories:**

    *   **Action:**  Actively monitor GitHub Security Advisories for updates related to `tj-actions/changed-files` or any other GitHub Actions you use.
    *   **How:**  Subscribe to notifications for security advisories in your GitHub repositories.  Regularly review the GitHub Security tab for any new vulnerabilities.

3.  **Implement Code Review and Vulnerability Scanning:**

    *   **Action:**  Introduce or enhance code review processes for your GitHub Actions workflows.  Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential security issues.
    *   **How:**  Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security scanners) into your CI/CD pipeline to check for common security vulnerabilities in your workflow files.  Ensure that all workflow changes are reviewed by at least one other team member.

4.  **Use a Secrets Management Solution:**

    *   **Action:**  If you are not already doing so, adopt a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   **How:**  Store sensitive credentials in the secrets management system instead of directly in GitHub Secrets.  Use the secrets management system's API to retrieve credentials within your GitHub Actions workflows. This provides better auditing, access control, and rotation capabilities.

5.  **Consider Forking Critical Actions:**

    *   **Action:** For GitHub Actions that are critical to your workflow, consider forking the action into your own GitHub organization. This gives you complete control over the code and reduces the risk of supply chain attacks.
    *   **How:**  Fork the GitHub repository containing the action.  Update your workflows to use your forked version of the action.  Implement a process for regularly updating your forked version from the upstream repository, while carefully reviewing the changes for any potential security issues.

6. **Avoid Using Unverified Third-Party Actions:**

    * **Action:** When possible, avoid using actions created by unknown or unverified sources. Prioritize actions maintained by trusted organizations.
    * **How:** Vet the action and its maintainers before use. Review the action's code and history, and consider its impact on your overall security posture.

**C. Communication:**

*   **Action:**  Communicate the details of this vulnerability and the remediation steps to all relevant stakeholders (developers, security teams, operations teams).
*   **How:**  Send out internal notifications, hold meetings, and update relevant documentation.

**5. Disclaimer:**

This remediation/mitigation strategy is based on the available information about CVE-2025-30066. It is important to adapt this strategy to your specific environment and to stay informed about any new developments related to this vulnerability. This is not an exhaustive list and your organization's security policies may require additional steps.
