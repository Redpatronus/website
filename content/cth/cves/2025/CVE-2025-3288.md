### Vulnerability: Local Code Execution in Rockwell Automation Arena®

**Description:** A local code execution vulnerability exists in Rockwell Automation Arena® due to improper validation of user-supplied data when processing DOE files. A threat actor can read outside of the allocated memory buffer, leading to information disclosure and arbitrary code execution.

**Severity:** High (CVSS v3 Score: 8.5)

**Known Exploit:** Exploitation requires a legitimate user to open a malicious DOE file crafted by the attacker.

### Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:

1.  **Vendor Patching:**
    *   Apply the official patch or update provided by Rockwell Automation as soon as it becomes available. Monitor Rockwell Automation's security advisories for updates regarding CVE-2025-3288.

2.  **User Awareness Training:**
    *   Educate users about the risks of opening untrusted or unexpected DOE files, especially from unknown or suspicious sources.
    *   Emphasize the importance of verifying the legitimacy of DOE files before opening them.

3.  **File Origin Verification:**
    *   Implement procedures to verify the origin and integrity of DOE files before they are opened.
    *   Consider using digital signatures or other mechanisms to ensure that DOE files have not been tampered with.

4.  **Input Validation:**
    *   Since the vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied data, investigate the possibility of implementing additional input validation measures on DOE files before they are fully processed. *Note: This is generally not possible by end-users and is a suggestion for the vendor.*

5.  **Restricted User Privileges:**
    *   Minimize user privileges to the least necessary for their roles. This can limit the impact of successful code execution. Consider running Arena® with limited user accounts where possible.

6.  **Antivirus/Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
    *   Ensure that up-to-date antivirus or EDR solutions are deployed on systems running Arena®. These solutions can help detect and prevent the execution of malicious code.

7.  **Network Segmentation:**
    *   Isolate systems running Arena® from other critical network segments to limit the potential spread of an attack.

8.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address other potential vulnerabilities in the system.
