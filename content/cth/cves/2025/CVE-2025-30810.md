### CVE-2025-30810: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Lead Form Data Collection to CRM Plugin

**Description:**

The Lead Form Data Collection to CRM plugin is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through form fields. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.5 (High)
*   **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Known Exploit:**

An attacker could craft malicious input in a lead form field designed to exploit the lack of input sanitization. By injecting SQL code within the crafted input, the attacker can manipulate the database query executed by the plugin. Due to it being a Blind SQL injection, exfiltration of data may involve time based or boolean based techniques.

**Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Update:** Upgrade the Lead Form Data Collection to CRM plugin to the latest version. If an update is not available (plugin is abandoned), consider migrating to a different, more secure lead form plugin.

2.  **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation on all form fields.

    *   **Whitelist:** Define a whitelist of allowed characters and formats for each form field.
    *   **Escaping:** Properly escape all user-supplied input before including it in SQL queries.  Use prepared statements or parameterized queries where possible.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the format of input data (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by the plugin has only the minimum necessary privileges to perform its intended functions. Restrict access to sensitive tables or operations.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests, including SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to protect against SQL injection vulnerabilities.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the plugin and the overall web application to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Utilize automated vulnerability scanners and penetration testing.

6.  **Disable Unused Features:** Disable any unused or unnecessary features within the plugin to reduce the attack surface.

7.  **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging of all database activity. This will help to detect and respond to suspicious activity that may indicate a SQL injection attack. Review logs regularly.

8. **Database Hardening:** Apply database hardening techniques to improve the security posture of the database server itself.
