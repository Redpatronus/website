## CVE-2025-2328: Arbitrary File Deletion in Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7

**Description:** The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress, in versions up to and including 1.3.8.7, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion. The vulnerability lies in the `dnd_remove_uploaded_files` function, which lacks sufficient validation of file paths. This allows unauthenticated attackers to manipulate the list of uploaded files by injecting arbitrary file paths, potentially leading to the deletion of critical files. This vulnerability is only exploitable if the Flamingo plugin is also installed and activated.

**Severity:** Critical (CVSS Score: 8.8)

**Known Exploit:**

1.  **Vulnerability:** Insufficient file path validation in the `dnd_remove_uploaded_files` function allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary file paths into the list of files associated with an uploaded message.
2.  **Condition:**  The Flamingo plugin *must* be installed and activated for the exploit to work. Flamingo stores uploaded files linked to Contact Form 7 messages.
3.  **Exploit Mechanism:** An attacker crafts a malicious request containing file path(s), such as `../../../../wp-config.php`, to be added to the message's file list. When an administrator views and deletes the message within Flamingo, the targeted files will be deleted from the server.
4.  **Impact:**  This allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server that the web server process has permissions to delete, including configuration files (like `wp-config.php`), plugin files, and other critical system files. This can lead to denial of service, data loss, and potentially remote code execution if a crucial system file is deleted and subsequently recreated with malicious content.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Action: Update the Plugin:**  The most critical step is to update the "Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7" plugin to the latest version, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
2.  **If Update is Not Possible:**
    *   **Disable the Plugin:** As a temporary measure, if updating is not possible, disable the "Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7" plugin entirely. This will prevent attackers from exploiting the vulnerability.
    *   **Disable Flamingo Plugin:** Disabling Flamingo will prevent the file deletion, but may remove important features.
3.  **Review File Permissions:** Ensure that the web server process has the least necessary permissions to prevent malicious file deletion. Avoid granting the web server write access to sensitive files and directories outside of the uploads directory.
4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:**  Implement WAF rules to detect and block requests containing suspicious file paths or attempts to manipulate file upload lists. Look for common directory traversal patterns (e.g., "../", "..\", "%2e%2e/") in request parameters related to file uploads.
5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially file paths. Sanitize user-provided filenames to remove any potentially dangerous characters or sequences.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your WordPress installation and plugins to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Monitor server logs for any unusual activity related to file uploads, deletions, or access to sensitive files. Look for patterns indicative of directory traversal or file manipulation attempts.
8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server process runs with the minimum privileges necessary to perform its functions. This limits the impact of a successful exploit.
9.  **Consider a File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) System:**  A FIM system can alert you to unauthorized changes to critical system files, allowing you to respond quickly to potential breaches.
