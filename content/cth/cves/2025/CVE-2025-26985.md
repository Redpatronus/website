## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-26985 - PHP Local File Inclusion in Majestic Support

**Vulnerability:** Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion' mislabeled, it is a Local File Inclusion - LFI)

**Software Affected:** Majestic Support versions up to and including 1.0.6

**Severity:** High

* **CVSS v3.1 Score:** 8.1 (Per provided data)
* **CVSS v3.1 Vector:** (Inferred based on score and vulnerability type - often not provided in raw reports)  Likely AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  (Network Attack Vector, Low Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, No Availability Impact)
* **Impact:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary files from the server on which the Majestic Support software is running. This can lead to:
    * **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other protected data.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By including a file containing malicious PHP code (e.g., uploaded as an image or log file), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user.
    * **Website Defacement:** Modification of website content.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although less likely, an attacker could include files that cause the application to crash.

**Description:**

CVE-2025-26985 describes a PHP Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability within the Majestic Support software.  The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when constructing file paths for include/require statements in PHP. This allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary file paths into the vulnerable parameter, causing the application to include and execute files outside of the intended directory.  The provided report mislabels this vulnerability as "PHP Remote File Inclusion" (RFI), but the description clearly indicates it is a Local File Inclusion. RFI allows execution of *remote* files, whereas LFI only allows execution of files on the *local* server.

**Known Exploit:**

While a specific exploit script might not be publicly available at the time this report was generated, LFI vulnerabilities are well-understood and easily exploitable.  A typical exploit would involve crafting a URL with a manipulated file path in a vulnerable parameter. For example:

http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd

This example attempts to include the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user account information on Linux systems.  A more dangerous exploit would involve including an uploaded file containing PHP code.

**Remediation Steps:**

1. **Upgrade to a patched version:** The most effective solution is to upgrade Majestic Support to a version *higher* than 1.0.6.  The vendor should release a patch addressing this vulnerability.  Check the official Majestic Support website or contact their support team for the latest version and release notes.

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
   * **Whitelist Allowed Files/Directories:** Instead of relying on blacklists, create a whitelist of allowed files or directories that can be included.  Only files within these whitelisted locations should be accessible.
   * **Sanitize User Input:**  Implement rigorous input validation to ensure that any user-supplied data used in file paths is properly sanitized.  This includes:
        * **Removing or encoding malicious characters:** Strip characters like `..`, `.` (multiple occurrences), `/`, `\`,  `%00` (null byte), and other path traversal characters.
        * **Validating the file extension:**  Ensure the file extension matches an expected type (e.g., `.php` if PHP execution is required, `.txt` for text files).
        * **Data Type Validation:**  Verify that the input conforms to the expected data type.

3. **Path Canonicalization:** Use functions like `realpath()` (in PHP) to resolve the absolute path of the file.  Then, compare the resolved path against a whitelist of allowed directories. This helps prevent path traversal exploits.  Example:

      $allowed_dir = "/var/www/majestic/includes/";
   $file = $_GET['page'];
   $filepath = realpath($allowed_dir . $file);

   if (strpos($filepath, $allowed_dir) === 0) {
       include($filepath);
   } else {
       die("Invalid file path.");
   }
   
4. **Disable `allow_url_include` in PHP:** While this is primarily for preventing RFI, disabling it can provide an additional layer of defense against potential misconfigurations.  Set `allow_url_include = Off` in your `php.ini` file.

5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests attempting to exploit LFI vulnerabilities.  Configure the WAF with rules that specifically target path traversal and file inclusion attacks.  Consider using regular expressions to identify suspicious patterns in URLs and POST data.

6. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web server user has the minimum necessary privileges to operate. Avoid running the web server as root.

7. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in your web applications.

**Mitigation Strategies (If immediate patching is not possible):**

If you cannot immediately apply a patch, implement the following mitigation strategies:

* **URL Rewriting/Filtering:**  Implement URL rewriting rules in your web server (e.g., Apache's `mod_rewrite` or Nginx) to block requests containing suspicious characters in URL parameters.
* **Limit Directory Access:**  Restrict access to sensitive directories on the server using file system permissions.
* **Monitor Logs:**  Actively monitor web server logs for suspicious activity, such as requests containing path traversal characters or attempts to access restricted files.

**Timeline:**

* **Immediate:** Assess the impact of this vulnerability on your system.
* **Within 24 hours:** Implement mitigation strategies if a patch is not immediately available.
* **Within 72 hours:**  Apply the vendor-supplied patch or upgrade to a secure version of Majestic Support.
* **Ongoing:** Continuously monitor logs, maintain security updates, and conduct regular security audits.

**Communication:**

* Inform relevant stakeholders about the vulnerability and the remediation plan.
* Keep users updated on the progress of the remediation efforts.

This strategy aims to provide a comprehensive approach to address the PHP Local File Inclusion vulnerability in Majestic Support.  Remember that patching is always the preferred solution, and mitigation strategies should be considered temporary measures until a patch can be applied.
