## CVE-2025-30290: Path Traversal Vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion

**Description:**

Adobe ColdFusion versions 2023.12, 2021.18, 2025.0 and earlier contain a path traversal vulnerability.  This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions and access files and directories outside of the intended restricted directory.  Exploitation requires user interaction.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
*   **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Known Exploit:**

While the provided information doesn't explicitly detail a *known* exploit, the description suggests potential exploitation vectors involving crafted requests or user-submitted data that manipulate file paths.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Apply the Security Patch:**  The primary and most effective remediation is to immediately apply the security updates released by Adobe to address CVE-2025-30290.  Upgrade to a version of ColdFusion *later* than 2025.0, 2023.12, and 2021.18.  Refer to the official Adobe security bulletin for the correct patched versions and installation instructions.

2.  **Input Validation & Sanitization:**  Review all ColdFusion code that handles file paths or interacts with the file system. Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious path manipulation. Specifically:
    *   **Whitelist Valid Characters:**  Ensure that any allowed characters in file paths are explicitly whitelisted. Reject any input containing unexpected or potentially dangerous characters like "..", "/", "\", etc.
    *   **Canonicalize Paths:**  Use ColdFusion functions (or equivalent) to canonicalize file paths to their absolute, resolved form. This will eliminate any "../" sequences or other path manipulation techniques.
    *   **Path Restriction:**  Enforce strict path restrictions using functions like `cfdirectory` or other appropriate ColdFusion security controls to ensure that user-supplied paths remain within the intended directories.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the ColdFusion server process and associated user accounts have only the minimum necessary permissions to access the file system.  Restrict write access to sensitive directories.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests attempting to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.  Configure the WAF with rules that specifically look for common path traversal patterns in HTTP requests.

5.  **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of ColdFusion applications to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities, including path traversal issues.

6.  **User Awareness Training:**  Provide training to users and developers on the risks associated with path traversal vulnerabilities and best practices for secure coding and file handling. Since user interaction is required for exploitation, educating users to be wary of suspicious links or file access requests is essential.

7.  **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of file system access attempts.  Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as attempts to access files or directories outside of the intended restricted areas. Configure alerts to notify administrators of any potential security incidents.

8.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Evaluate whether all file-related features in ColdFusion are necessary. Disable or restrict access to features that are not essential for the application's functionality.

By implementing these remediation and mitigation strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation of CVE-2025-30290 and protect your ColdFusion applications from path traversal attacks.
