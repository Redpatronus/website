## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-30004

**Vulnerability Description:** Command Injection in Xorcom CompletePBX Task Scheduler

Xorcom CompletePBX versions up to and including 5.2.35 are vulnerable to command injection.  An attacker can leverage the administrator Task Scheduler functionality to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system with root privileges.

**Severity:** Critical

*   CVSS v3.1 Score: 9.1 (Critical)
*   Impact: Allows for complete system compromise, including data theft, system disruption, and potentially establishing a foothold for further attacks within the network.

**Known Exploit:**

An attacker can craft a malicious task schedule that includes OS commands within the task name, description, or execution parameters. When the task is executed by the CompletePBX system, the injected commands are interpreted and executed as root.

**Remediation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Action: Upgrade to a Patched Version:**  The primary and most effective remediation is to upgrade Xorcom CompletePBX to a version greater than 5.2.35 where this vulnerability is patched.  Obtain the latest version from the vendor's official website or through their designated update channels.  Verify the new version contains a fix for CVE-2025-30004 in its release notes.

2.  **Interim Mitigation (If immediate upgrade is not possible):**

    *   **Restrict Access to Task Scheduler:**  Limit access to the Task Scheduler functionality to only authorized administrators.  Review existing user permissions and revoke any unnecessary privileges.
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on all data submitted to the Task Scheduler.  Specifically, filter out shell metacharacters (e.g., `&`, `;`, `|`, `>`, `<`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`)  and other potentially dangerous input from task names, descriptions, and execution parameters.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (for the Task Scheduler process):** If technically feasible, restrict the permissions of the process that executes tasks created by the Task Scheduler.  Ideally, it should run under a non-root user account with minimal required privileges.

3.  **Long-Term Security Practices:**

    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the CompletePBX system to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement a vulnerability scanning solution to automatically identify and report on known vulnerabilities in the system.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Train administrators and users on common security threats and best practices to prevent exploitation.
    *   **Stay Informed:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (like VulnCheck, NIST NVD, etc.) to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and security updates for CompletePBX.

**Mitigation Monitoring:**

*   **Monitor System Logs:**  Continuously monitor system logs for any suspicious activity, such as unexpected process execution or attempts to access restricted resources.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect and alert on potential command injection attempts.
