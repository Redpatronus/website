### CVE-2025-27932: Path Traversal Vulnerability in HGW-BL1500HM USB Storage File Deletion

**Description:**

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the file deletion process of the USB storage file-sharing function of HGW-BL1500HM routers, version 002.002.003 and earlier.  This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the file path used in the deletion process to access and potentially delete files outside the intended restricted directory.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 8.1 (High)
*   **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

**Known Exploit:**

An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request to the file deletion endpoint of the USB storage file-sharing function. The attacker would need to include a specially crafted file path that uses ".." sequences or other path traversal techniques to navigate outside of the intended directory. By manipulating the path, the attacker can target arbitrary files on the device's file system. This could lead to deletion of critical system files and lead to a denial of service condition.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Upgrade Firmware:**  The primary mitigation is to upgrade the HGW-BL1500HM router firmware to a version that addresses this vulnerability. Check the manufacturer's website (or contact them directly) for available firmware updates.  Apply the update as soon as it becomes available.

2.  **Restrict USB Storage Access:** If a firmware update is not immediately available, consider temporarily disabling the USB storage file-sharing function or restrict access to only trusted users. This reduces the attack surface.

3.  **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the server-side to sanitize file paths before passing them to the file deletion function. Specifically, the following checks should be implemented:

    *   **Path Normalization:** Normalize the path to remove redundant separators and resolve relative references (e.g., `..`).
    *   **Path Filtering:**  Implement a whitelist approach to only allow access to files within a specific directory.
    *   **Invalid Character Checks:**  Reject paths containing characters like "..", "./", or any other characters that are indicative of path traversal attacks.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the process responsible for file deletion operates with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running the process as root or with other overly permissive user accounts.

5.  **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement thorough logging and monitoring of file deletion activities.  Alert on suspicious behavior, such as deletion attempts outside the expected directory.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) in front of the router's web interface to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.

7.  **Security Audits:**  Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the HGW-BL1500HM router's firmware to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
