## CVE-2025-24447: ColdFusion Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability

**Description:** ColdFusion versions 2023.12, 2021.18, 2025.0 and earlier are affected by a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**Severity:** Critical (CVSS Score: 9.1)

**Known Exploit:** Exploitation requires user interaction. A victim must open a malicious file crafted by the attacker. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the ColdFusion server.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Patching:** Apply the security update released by Adobe as soon as it becomes available.  This is the primary and most effective method of remediation.  Monitor the Adobe Security Bulletin for updates and specific patch versions.

2.  **Disable Deserialization (If Possible):**  Investigate if deserialization of untrusted data can be disabled or restricted within the ColdFusion configuration. This may require significant code changes to existing applications that rely on deserialization.  Consider the impact on functionality before implementing this mitigation.  Consult Adobe's documentation for best practices.

3.  **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization measures on all data received by the ColdFusion server, especially any data that may be used in deserialization processes (even if you are unable to determine specific vulnerable points). This can help prevent the injection of malicious serialized objects.

4.  **User Awareness Training:**  Educate users about the risks of opening files from untrusted sources. Emphasize the importance of verifying the authenticity and safety of files before opening them.

5.  **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the ColdFusion server from other critical systems on the network to limit the potential impact of a successful exploit.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF with rulesets designed to detect and block common deserialization attacks.  Ensure the WAF is regularly updated with the latest threat intelligence.

7.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Configure IDS/IPS systems to monitor for suspicious activity related to deserialization attacks.

8.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure the ColdFusion server process is running with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the damage an attacker can do if they gain code execution.

9.  **Monitor Logs:**  Monitor ColdFusion server logs for any unusual activity or errors that may indicate a potential exploit attempt.

10. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the ColdFusion environment to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
