### CVE-2025-2632: Out-of-Bounds Write in NI LabVIEW

**Description:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in NI LabVIEW due to improper bounds checking when reading CPU information from the cache. This flaw can lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.5 (High)
*   **Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Local Access, Low Complexity, No Privileges Required, User Interaction Required, Scope Unchanged, Confidentiality Impact High, Integrity Impact High, Availability Impact High)

**Known Exploit:** Successful exploitation requires an attacker to convince a user to open a specially crafted VI (LabVIEW Virtual Instrument file).

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Apply Patch/Upgrade:** Upgrade to a patched version of NI LabVIEW that addresses CVE-2025-2632.  NI will release a patched version in a future release. Ensure the upgrade is performed across all affected systems.

2.  **User Awareness Training:**  Implement user awareness training programs to educate users about the risks of opening files from untrusted sources, especially VI files. Emphasize the importance of verifying the source and integrity of files before opening them.

3.  **Restrict File Access:** Implement organizational policies and technical controls to restrict users' ability to open untrusted files.

4.  **Antivirus/Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Ensure that all systems running NI LabVIEW have up-to-date antivirus or EDR solutions.  Configure these solutions to scan VI files for malicious content.

5.  **Sandboxing/Virtualization:**  Consider running NI LabVIEW within a sandboxed or virtualized environment. This can limit the impact of a successful exploit by isolating the application from the underlying operating system.

6. **VI Analysis:** Develop or utilize automated tools capable of analyzing VI files for suspicious code or potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Network Segmentation:** If possible, isolate systems running NI LabVIEW on a separate network segment to limit the potential spread of an exploit.
