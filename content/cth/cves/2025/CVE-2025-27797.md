### Vulnerability: OS Command Injection in Wi-Fi AP UNIT 'AC-WPS-11ac series'

**Description:**

The Wi-Fi AP UNIT 'AC-WPS-11ac series' is vulnerable to OS command injection. A remote attacker, authenticated and logged into the device, can inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
*   **Vector:** CVSS:3.x/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Known Exploit:**

A remote, authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands through a specific service within the Wi-Fi AP UNIT. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the vulnerable service, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Affected Devices:** Immediately identify all instances of the 'AC-WPS-11ac series' Wi-Fi AP UNIT within the network.

2.  **Apply Security Patches:**
    *   Check for and immediately apply the latest firmware updates or security patches provided by the vendor.  This is the primary solution.
    *   Monitor the vendor's website and security advisories for updates related to CVE-2025-27797.

3.  **Restrict Network Access:**
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the exposure of the Wi-Fi AP UNIT to other critical systems.
    *   Restrict access to the management interface to only authorized personnel and networks.

4.  **Strengthen Authentication:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if supported by the device.
    *   Disable default accounts or change default credentials immediately.

5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   If patching is not immediately possible, implement input validation and sanitization on the affected service to prevent the injection of malicious commands (this might require custom scripting or configuration depending on the device's capabilities and should be done with caution).  This is only a temporary workaround.

6.  **Intrusion Detection and Monitoring:**
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to command injection attempts.
    *   Monitor system logs for any unusual activity, especially related to command execution.

7.  **Disable Unnecessary Services:**
    *   Disable any unnecessary services or features on the Wi-Fi AP UNIT to reduce the attack surface.

8.  **Vendor Communication:**
    *   Contact the vendor (or distributor) for support and to inquire about available patches or workarounds.

9.  **Emergency Procedures:**
    *   Develop an incident response plan in case of successful exploitation. This should include steps for isolating the affected device, containing the spread of the attack, and restoring system functionality.

10. **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure, including Wi-Fi AP UNITs.
