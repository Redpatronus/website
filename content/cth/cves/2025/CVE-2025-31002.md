### Vulnerability: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

**Description:** The Squeeze plugin, versions 1.6 and earlier, is vulnerable to unrestricted file uploads. This allows attackers to upload files with potentially dangerous extensions (e.g., PHP, .exe, .js) to the server.  These files can then be executed, leading to remote code execution (RCE) or other malicious activity.

**Severity:** Critical

*   CVSS v3.1 Score: 9.1 (Critical)
*   Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Known Exploit:**

An unauthenticated user can upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) to the server through the plugin's upload functionality. Once uploaded, the attacker can access this file via a web browser, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Remediation / Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Action: Upgrade to a patched version.** The most effective solution is to upgrade the Squeeze plugin to a version that includes a fix for CVE-2025-31002. Contact the plugin developer (Bogdan Bendziukov) for a patched release or an official advisory. If a patch is not available remove the plugin immediately.

2.  **Implement File Type Validation:** If upgrading or removing is not immediately possible, implement server-side file type validation.
    *   **Whitelist acceptable file extensions:**  Allow only necessary file types, such as images (.jpg, .png, .gif) or documents (.pdf, .doc). Block all other file extensions.
    *   **Verify MIME types:** Check the MIME type of the uploaded file against the allowed list.  Do *not* rely solely on the file extension, as it can be easily spoofed. Use functions like `mime_content_type()` in PHP (or equivalent functions in other languages) for accurate MIME type detection.
    *   **Sanitize file names:**  Ensure that file names do not contain malicious code or characters that could be used in directory traversal or other attacks.

3.  **Restrict Upload Directory Permissions:**
    *   **Limit execute permissions:**  Configure the upload directory to prevent the execution of uploaded files. Set the permissions so that the web server can only read and write to the directory, but not execute files within it.
    *   **Isolate the upload directory:**  Place the upload directory outside the web server's root directory to prevent direct access through a web browser.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Configure a strong CSP to restrict the execution of scripts from untrusted sources. This can help mitigate the impact of malicious JavaScript files that may be uploaded.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious file upload attempts.  Configure the WAF with rules to identify and prevent the upload of files with dangerous extensions or MIME types.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the web application and all plugins to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

7.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**
    *   Implement monitoring systems to detect unusual file uploads or execution of files from the upload directory.  Alert administrators to any suspicious activity.

8.  **User Education:**  Educate users about the risks of uploading files and the importance of verifying the source of all uploaded files. Although in this case the vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction, general awareness is always beneficial.
