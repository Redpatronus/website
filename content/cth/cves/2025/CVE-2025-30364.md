## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-30364 - WeGIA SQL Injection Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-30364, a SQL Injection vulnerability found in WeGIA, a web manager for charitable institutions.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA Web Manager (versions prior to 3.2.8)
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `/WeGIA/html/funcionario/remuneracao.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id_funcionario`
*   **Description:**  An unvalidated `id_funcionario` parameter in the `/WeGIA/html/funcionario/remuneracao.php` endpoint allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially complete system compromise.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:**  Based on the information provided, a CVSS score of 10.0 is indicated. This represents the *highest* severity level.  The description also mentions impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
*   **Severity Level:** Critical

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   While the provided data doesn't explicitly state a public exploit, the nature of SQL Injection vulnerabilities makes them relatively easy to exploit.  An attacker with basic SQL knowledge could construct malicious payloads to leverage this vulnerability.  The vulnerability has been published, so it is highly likely a PoC exploit will become readily available.
*   Given the critical severity and potential ease of exploitation, it should be assumed that an exploit exists or can be easily developed.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.8 or later.** This version contains a fix for the SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Affected Systems:**  Locate all installations of WeGIA running versions prior to 3.2.8.  This might involve inventory management or manual inspection of each system.
2.  **Backup:**  Before applying any changes, create a complete backup of the WeGIA database and application files. This will allow you to restore the system to its previous state if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
3.  **Upgrade WeGIA:** Upgrade to version 3.2.8 or the latest available version. Follow the vendor's instructions for upgrading WeGIA. This will likely involve downloading the new version and replacing the existing files. Consult the WeGIA documentation for specific upgrade instructions.
4.  **Verification:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the application to ensure it is functioning correctly.  Specifically, test the `remuneracao.php` endpoint with various inputs to verify that the SQL Injection vulnerability is no longer present.  Consider using a Web Application Security Scanner (WAS) or penetration testing to validate the fix.
5.  **Documentation:**  Document the upgrade process, including the date, time, version upgraded to, and any issues encountered.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If immediate upgrade is not possible):**

If an immediate upgrade to version 3.2.8 is not possible, implement the following mitigation measures as a temporary workaround:

1.  **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation on the `id_funcionario` parameter in the `/WeGIA/html/funcionario/remuneracao.php` endpoint.  Ensure that the input is a valid integer and does not contain any SQL keywords or special characters. This should be implemented on the server-side, *not* just the client-side, to be effective.
2.  **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Rewrite the SQL query used in the `remuneracao.php` endpoint to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This technique prevents SQL Injection by treating user input as data rather than executable code.  This is the *preferred* method if code changes are feasible without a full upgrade.
3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the WeGIA application. Configure the WAF to detect and block SQL Injection attacks targeting the `remuneracao.php` endpoint.  While a WAF can help, it should not be considered a complete solution, as it can be bypassed.
4.  **Database Permissions:**  Limit the database user's permissions to the absolute minimum required for the application to function. This reduces the potential impact of a successful SQL Injection attack. For example, grant only `SELECT` permissions where appropriate, rather than `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`.
5.  **Monitor and Alert:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity on the WeGIA application.  Monitor for unusual database queries or errors that could indicate a SQL Injection attempt.  Configure alerts to notify security personnel of any detected anomalies.

**6. Post-Remediation/Mitigation Activities:**

1.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the WeGIA application to identify and address any new vulnerabilities.
2.  **Stay Updated:**  Subscribe to security advisories from the WeGIA vendor to stay informed of any new vulnerabilities and security updates.
3.  **Security Training:**  Provide security awareness training to developers and system administrators on secure coding practices and common web application vulnerabilities.
4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Implement automated vulnerability scanning as part of the development lifecycle to catch SQL injection vulnerabilities before they are deployed to production.

**7. Timeline:**

*   **Immediate (within 24 hours):** Identify affected systems and implement temporary mitigation strategies.
*   **High Priority (within 72 hours):** Upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.8 or later on all affected systems.
*   **Ongoing:** Implement regular security audits, monitoring, and training.

**Important Considerations:**

*   This strategy assumes that the vendor provides accurate and timely updates and documentation.
*   The effectiveness of the mitigation strategies depends on their proper implementation and configuration.
*   Regularly review and update this strategy as new information becomes available.
*   Consult with security experts for assistance in implementing this remediation strategy.
