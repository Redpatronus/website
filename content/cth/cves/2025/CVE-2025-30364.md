## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2025-30364 - WeGIA SQL Injection Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-30364, a SQL Injection vulnerability in the WeGIA Web manager for charitable institutions.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Component:** `/WeGIA/html/funcionario/remuneracao.php` - specifically, the `id_funcionario` parameter.
*   **Affected Versions:** WeGIA versions prior to 3.2.8
*   **Description:** The vulnerable endpoint allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands through the `id_funcionario` parameter. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database server.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical) - Based on the provided data.
*   **Severity Level:** Critical
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** High - Sensitive data such as employee information, financial records, and donor details can be exposed.
    *   **Integrity:** High - Data can be modified or deleted, leading to corruption and unreliable information.
    *   **Availability:** High - The application or database can be rendered unavailable due to malicious SQL queries or data corruption.

**3. Known Exploits:**

*   While the provided data doesn't explicitly list specific exploits, the nature of SQL Injection means there are various techniques an attacker can use.  Common exploit vectors include:
    *   **Retrieving Sensitive Data:** Using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from other tables.
    *   **Bypassing Authentication:**  Modifying SQL queries to bypass login credentials.
    *   **Modifying Data:**  Inserting, updating, or deleting records in the database.
    *   **Executing Operating System Commands (in some configurations):** Using features like `xp_cmdshell` (if enabled in SQL Server) to execute system commands on the database server.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary remediation is to **immediately upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.8 or later**. This version contains the fix for CVE-2025-30364.  Here's a breakdown of the steps:

*   **4.1 Immediate Action (Critical):**
    *   **Upgrade WeGIA:**  Upgrade all instances of WeGIA to version 3.2.8 or the latest available version.  This is the most effective way to address the vulnerability.
    *   **Verify Upgrade:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the application to ensure it is functioning correctly.  Pay close attention to the functionality that uses the `/WeGIA/html/funcionario/remuneracao.php` endpoint.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Immediate Upgrade is Not Possible):**

If an immediate upgrade to version 3.2.8 is not feasible, implement the following mitigations. **These mitigations are *not* a substitute for upgrading, but can reduce the risk until an upgrade can be performed.**

*   **5.1 Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Implement Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all input received from the `id_funcionario` parameter.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  Use proper escaping and encoding techniques to prevent malicious SQL code from being interpreted as code.  This should be done *at the application level, before the data reaches the database*.
    *   **Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):**  This is the most effective defense against SQL injection. Prepared statements treat all input as data, preventing it from being interpreted as SQL code.
*   **5.2 Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Deploy a WAF:**  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) configured with rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts.  Ensure the WAF is properly tuned for the specific application.
    *   **Monitor WAF Logs:** Regularly monitor WAF logs to identify and respond to suspicious activity.
*   **5.3 Database Security Hardening:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the WeGIA application has the *minimum* necessary privileges to perform its functions.  Avoid using a database account with administrative privileges.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any database features that are not required by the application, such as `xp_cmdshell` (in SQL Server).
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the database server to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **5.4 Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Configure an IDS to monitor network traffic and system logs for suspicious activity related to SQL injection attempts.
    *   **Centralized Logging:**  Implement centralized logging to collect and analyze logs from the WeGIA application, web server, and database server.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify security personnel of suspicious activity or potential attacks.

**6. Verification:**

*   After implementing the remediation and/or mitigation strategies, thoroughly test the application to verify that the vulnerability has been addressed.  Use penetration testing tools and techniques to simulate real-world attacks.
*   Review code changes related to input validation and sanitization to ensure they are effective.

**7. Communication:**

*   Inform all relevant stakeholders (developers, system administrators, security personnel, and management) about the vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation plan.
*   Provide clear instructions on how to upgrade WeGIA and implement the necessary security measures.
*   Establish a communication channel for reporting any security-related issues.

**8. Ongoing Security:**

*   Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure that security is considered throughout the development process.
*   Conduct regular security training for developers and system administrators.
*   Stay informed about the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly review and update security policies and procedures.

**Important Considerations:**

*   The mitigations listed above are not a replacement for patching.  **Upgrading to version 3.2.8 (or later) remains the primary and most effective solution.**
*   This document provides a general remediation/mitigation strategy. The specific steps required may vary depending on your environment.
*   Consult with security experts to ensure that the implemented security measures are appropriate for your organization.
