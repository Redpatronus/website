## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2024-12144 - SQL Injection in Finder ERP/CRM (Old System)

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2024-12144, a critical SQL Injection vulnerability identified in Finder Fire Safety Finder ERP/CRM (Old System).

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12144
*   **Description:** The vulnerability involves an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command, commonly known as SQL Injection.  This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into input fields within the Finder ERP/CRM (Old System) application.  This injected code can then be executed by the database server, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Bypass authentication and authorization controls.
    *   Read sensitive data from the database (e.g., customer data, financial records, internal documents).
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server itself.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
*   **Rationale:** The high CVSS score reflects the significant impact of a successful exploit.  SQL Injection vulnerabilities can lead to complete compromise of the affected system and data, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**3. Affected Systems:**

*   Finder ERP/CRM (Old System) versions prior to 18.12.2024.

**4. Known Exploits:**

*   While the provided information doesn't explicitly state a publicly available exploit, SQL Injection is a well-understood and frequently targeted vulnerability.  Given the severity, it's highly probable that attackers will attempt to discover and exploit this vulnerability. Automated scanning tools are likely to detect the presence of this vulnerability if present.

**5. Remediation Strategy:**

The *primary* remediation strategy is to **upgrade to a patched version of Finder ERP/CRM (Old System)** released *after* 18.12.2024. The vendor should provide a version with appropriate input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks. This is the most effective and permanent solution.

**6. Mitigation Strategy (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible):**

If an immediate upgrade is not feasible, implement the following mitigation measures:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied input that is used in SQL queries.  This includes:
    *   **Whitelist validation:**  Only allow known good characters and formats. Reject anything that doesn't match.
    *   **Blacklist filtering:**  Filter out known SQL keywords and special characters (e.g., `', ", ;, --, /*, */, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, UNION`).  *However, blacklist filtering is generally considered less secure than whitelist validation.*
    *   **Encoding:**  Encode user input to prevent it from being interpreted as SQL code.
*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible.  This separates the SQL code from the data, preventing the data from being interpreted as code.  This is the *best* defense against SQL Injection when writing SQL queries.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user accounts used by the Finder ERP/CRM application have only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions.  Avoid using database administrator accounts.  If an attacker gains access, they will only be able to perform actions permitted to that user.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.  Configure the WAF with rules specific to SQL injection attacks.  Regularly update the WAF rules.
*   **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):**  Implement DAM to monitor database activity for suspicious patterns, such as unusual SQL queries or attempts to access sensitive data.  Set up alerts for potentially malicious activity.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the Finder ERP/CRM system.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Database Features:** Disable any database features that are not required by the application, such as stored procedure execution or command execution.
*   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, segment the network so that the database server is isolated from other systems.  This can limit the impact of a successful attack.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Enable detailed logging for the Finder ERP/CRM application and database server.  Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.  Ensure the logs include sufficient information to investigate potential attacks.

**7. Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Inventory:** Identify all instances of Finder ERP/CRM (Old System) running versions prior to 18.12.2024.
2.  **Prioritize:** Prioritize systems for upgrade based on their importance and exposure to the internet.
3.  **Testing:** Before deploying any changes to the production environment, thoroughly test the patched version or implemented mitigations in a non-production environment.
4.  **Deployment:** Deploy the patched version or mitigations to the production environment.
5.  **Verification:** After deployment, verify that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed by performing vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
6.  **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the system for suspicious activity and review logs regularly.

**8. Communication:**

*   Inform all relevant stakeholders (e.g., IT security team, system administrators, application owners) about the vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation strategy.
*   Keep stakeholders informed of the progress of the remediation effort.

**9. Responsibilities:**

*   **IT Security Team:** Responsible for assessing the vulnerability, developing the remediation/mitigation strategy, and performing vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
*   **System Administrators:** Responsible for deploying the patched version or implementing the mitigations.
*   **Application Owners:** Responsible for testing the patched version or mitigations and for monitoring the system for suspicious activity.

**10. Conclusion:**

Addressing CVE-2024-12144 is critical to protecting the Finder ERP/CRM (Old System) and the sensitive data it stores. Prioritize upgrading to the latest patched version.  If an upgrade is not immediately possible, implement the recommended mitigation measures to reduce the risk of exploitation.  Regular monitoring and testing are essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the security controls.
