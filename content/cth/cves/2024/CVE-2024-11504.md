## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy: CVE-2024-11504

**Vulnerability Description:** SQL Injection in Streamsoft Prestiż due to improper sanitization of input from multiple fields. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Severity:** High (CVSS Score: 8.6)

**Known Exploit:** Exploitable by an authenticated remote attacker. Specific exploit details are not publicly available, but the nature of SQL injection vulnerabilities allows for potential database access, modification, or deletion.

**Remediation:**

*   **Upgrade:** Immediately upgrade Streamsoft Prestiż to version 18.1.376.37 or later, which contains the fix for this vulnerability. This is the primary and recommended remediation step.

**Mitigation (if immediate upgrade is not possible):**

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement or configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests targeting the Streamsoft Prestiż application. The WAF should be configured with rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
*   **Input Validation:** If possible, implement additional input validation on the server-side to further sanitize input from all fields before processing. This should include escaping special characters and enforcing strict data type validation.  However, *this should not be considered a replacement for patching*.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user used by Streamsoft Prestiż has the minimum necessary privileges to perform its functions. Restrict access to sensitive data and operations.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Increase monitoring of Streamsoft Prestiż application logs and database logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual database queries or error messages related to SQL. Configure alerts to notify security personnel of potential attacks.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Streamsoft Prestiż server on a separate network segment with limited access to other critical systems. This can help contain the impact of a successful exploit.

**Note:** Mitigation strategies are temporary measures and should be implemented in conjunction with, or until, the permanent remediation (upgrade) can be applied.
